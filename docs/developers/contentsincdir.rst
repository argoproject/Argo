Functions in directories:
-------------------------
**Customizer**: Adds Largo-specific functionality to the 
`Customizer <http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ via the 
`Theme Customization API <https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API>`_ and four [[custom classes|Largo custom classes]]. The ``customizer`` directory also contains relevant CSS and JavaScript.

**Picturefill**: 
`Picturefill.WP <https://wordpress.org/plugins/picturefillwp/>`_ is a plugin that uses 
`picturefill.js <https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/>`_ to load responsive and retina images, mimicking the HTML5 <picture> spec.
**Widgets**: Largo's custom widgets. For more information about each widget, see [[Sidebars and widgets]].

**WP-Taxonomy-Landing**: Provides a new post type, Landing Page. Requests to a taxonomy archive, such as a category or tag page, will check if a Landing Page has that taxonomy set. If one exists, and the request is for the landing page (that is, not an explicit request for page 1 or any following page), the Landing Page is displayed rather than the normal page 1 of the taxonomy archive.
