For Developers
==============

Overview
--------

Project Largo is released as open source software and anyone is welcome to `download or fork the project from our github repository <https://github.com/INN/Largo>`_ and use it as they like.

If you use Largo for a project `we'd love to hear from you <mailto:largo@inn.org>`_ so can we add you to our list of sites using Largo and help get the word out.

The preferred way of building a site with Largo is by creating a WordPress child theme. We have created a `sample, heavily documented, child theme <childthemes.html#advanced-theme-development-and-modification>`_ to help you understand the way we structure our child themes in the hopes that it will give you a solid framework to get started. There is more information on setting up Largo and `using child themes <../users/download.html#creating-child-themes>`_ in the download and installation section of our documentation.

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

We use a set of tools to make setting up a Largo development environment as easy and consistent as possible.

We encourage all INN member organizations looking to add features to or otherwise modify their theme to use this same setup, since doing so will make support and collaboration between members and INN easier.

Child Themes
------------

What *is* a child theme?
````````````````````````

From the `WordPress Codex <http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes>`_:

  A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes are the recommended way of modifying an existing theme.

Why should you use a child theme?
`````````````````````````````````
In order to make it easier to upgrade to future versions of the Largo parent theme, you will want to add any customizations that are unique to your site by creating a child theme. WordPress has a tutorial you can follow that explains how to create and configure a child theme.
