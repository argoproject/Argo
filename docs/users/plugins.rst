Plugins
=======

Overview
--------

WordPress plugins are modules that extend the functionality of WordPress. Anyone can write them and WordPress maintains a `directory of available plugins <https://wordpress.org/plugins/>`_. Since anyone can write them, this means that plugins vary widely in quality so we've curated a list of plugins that add functionality commonly needed by news organizations and that we have tested to ensure they work well together and do not cause compatibility issues that sometimes crop up when using less-trusted plugins.

For hosted INN member sites using Largo, this is a complete list of the plugins that are currently installed and available in our production environment.

Note that since we use WordPress multisite, individual site admins are not able to install and activate plugins; This needs to be done at the network level.

If you would like to have a plugin added to this list or installed and activated for your site we prefer that you contact us through the Largo help desk and describe the functionality you are trying to add rather than asking if we'll install Plugin X for you. In some cases what you are after might already be possible in Largo and/or we might know of a better plugin to accomplish the desired result.

We strive to maintain a secure environment for all of our hosted Largo sites and to avoid potential compatibility issues, so in some cases we may refuse to install a particular plugin if we believe it might cause problems for you or for us. We will, however, always try to work with you and recommend an alternative.

Here is a complete list of the plugins currently installed and available.
