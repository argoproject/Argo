Contact pages
=============

Creating a contact page is as simple as creating a new page and putting the following in the editor, on its own line:

``[clean-contact]``

Feel free to put additional information on the page. You can also use the ``[clean-contact]`` shortcode in posts, to provide a contact form there.
