Custom landing pages
====================
 
Custom landing pages allow you to summarize a series of posts or tie a project together. For one example, see http://inewsnetwork.org/series/hit-and-run: the project page begins with a summary of the series, followed by posts within the series.
Creating a custom landing page is a simple process.

	1. Make sure "Custom Landing Pages for Series/Project Pages" is enabled in *Appearance* > *Theme 	Options* > *Advanced*.
	2. Create a series
	3. Add the series to posts
	4. Create the landing page
	
**Creating a series**

Create a series in *Posts* > *Series*. Each series should have a name and a slug. If the new series is part of an already-existing series, you can add the parent series from the drop-down. The description is displayed in the standard landing page layout. The sidebar can be chosen from a list of sidebars. If you want, you can [[create a sidebar just for this series|Theme options]] in *Appearance* > *Theme Options* > *Layout Options* > *Sidebar Options*.

Once the new series has been saved ("Add New Category"), you can apply it to posts.

**Applying series to posts**

Applying a series to a post can be done by selecting the appropriate series from the series list in the post editor.
