How to Access INN Support for Largo
===================================

We love helping our members, clients, and the entire nonprofit news community perform acts of great journalism. We want to make it easy for you to approach us with support requests, and we want you to help you succeed. Our team is also pretty busy making things, and we need to somehow survive all demands on our time. 

**When you approach us with a Largo support request**, we hope you will begin by consulting our `documentation <http://largo.readthedocs.org/>`_ and `knowledge base <http://confluence.inn.org/display/LKB/Largo+Knowledge+Base>`_. If you have a general question about using WordPress, you can find good stuff in the WordPress Codex and Support Forums.

If you don’t find a good answer, please visit our `Help Desk <http://jira.inn.org/servicedesk/customer/portal/4>`_ and submit a ticket.

If you are a developer and see a bug that needs fixing, or would like to suggest a new Largo feature, we’d love for you to create an issue in the `Largo GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/INN/Largo/issues>`_. 

Please include when submitting your ticket:

* One topic or question per ticket
* The URL of your website, or any page for which the ticket pertains
* As much detail as possible about the specific issue or request. A screenshot is often very helpful. 

**You'll hear back from us within a day (during the standard work week)** at which point we may ask you for clarification, and share some initial suggestions and resources to address your request.  We'll also provide an estimate of how long we expect it will take to either solve your specific request or incorporate a solution into our development cycle.

**If we are not able to offer a short term solution**, we will let you know about our next steps, recommend vendors we trust, or point you toward tools and resources that could help.

**Approach us with problems to solve or questions about possibilities, not specific solutions.** To create tools that support our users we prefer to start with the question or problem we're trying to solve, and work to find a solution. Largo continues to evolve and we continually improve it to find the best solutions.

*Please note that modifications or customizations beyond those options built into the Largo theme specific to your site are available on a fee based consulting service basis. Contact Adam at adam@inn.org to discuss how we can be of help.*
