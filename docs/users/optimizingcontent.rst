Optimizing content
==================

1. Determine the word or phrase you want that page to rank for.

2. Include that word or phrase in the story title and in the story permalink. Putting the term in the title usually puts it in the permalink, as seen at the top of the editor. If it doesn't, you may want to examine the permalink settings available in *Dashboard* > *Settings* > *Permalinks*
3. Include the word or phrase in your post excerpt.
4. Include the word or phrase in your story, but not too much. Keep it readable. 
5. If your story uses heading tags such as <h1>, make sure the term is in the headings.
6. Include links in your content:
    internal links to previous and current coverage
    external links to other coverage or to relevant websites
    add relevant stories `post IDs <http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Working_with_WordPress#How_do_I_determine_a_Post.2C_Page.2C_Category.2C_Tag.2C_Link.2C_Link_Category.2C_or_User_ID.3F>`_ to the "Related Posts" field in the Additional Options widget in the post editor.
7. Include your word or phrase image filenames, title and alt tags.  Tag your story with the term, and set it as the top term for that story in the Additional Options widget in the post editor.
