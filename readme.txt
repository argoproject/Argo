== ABOUT PROJECT LARGO ==

Project Largo is a responsively designed WordPress parent theme designed and optimized to support long form journalism.

The project extends work done by NPR's Project Argo (http://argoproject.org/).

Documentation and more information at: http://largoproject.org

VERSION: 0.1

== SETUP ==

* Download and Install WordPress
* Download the latest version of the Largo parent theme
* Create a child theme and activate from the WordPress appearance menu
* Install required/recommended plugins
* Configure your theme options in the Appearance > Theme Options menu
* Configure your menus and sidebars (also in the Appearance menu)

Additionally, you can customize your child theme's CSS by overriding Largo's default styles in the style.css file of your child theme.

Future versions of the Largo framework will support more style customizations (color, typography, etc.) via theme options and you might find it useful to recompile a new set of styles from the LESS stylesheets included with the Largo parent theme.
